[write in go视频](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJvEIjRBSDA&feature=youtu.be)

辛辛苦苦敲打的字幕

	The schedule's tight on the cluseter tonight so parallelized my code

	all those threads and continuations my head's going to explode

	and all that boilerplate that FactoryBuilderAdapterDelegateImpl doesn't exsit anymore

	seams unjustified give me something simple

	don't write in scheme

	don't write in c

	no more pointers that i forgot to free()

	java's verbose python's too slow

	it's time you know

	write in GO!

	write in GO!

	no inheritance anymore

	write in GO!

	write in GO!

	there's no do or while just for 

	i dont'care what your linters say i've got tools for that

	the code never botherd me anway

	it's funny how some features make every change seem small

	And the errors that once slowed me don't get down at all 

	it's time to see what GO can do cause it seams too good to be true

	no long compile times for i'm free

	write in GO!

	write in GO!

	kiss your pointer math goodbye

	write in GO!

	write in GO!

	time to give GC a try

	i don't cate if my structures stay on the heap or stack

	my program spawns its goroutines without a sound

	control is spiraling through buffered channels all around

	i don't remeber why i erver once subclassed

	i'm never going back

	my tests all build and pass

	write in GO!

	write in GO!

	you won't use eclipse anymore

	write in GO!

	write in GO!

	who cares what boost is for

	i don't care what the tech leads say 

	i'll rewrite it all

	writing code nenver botherd me anyway
