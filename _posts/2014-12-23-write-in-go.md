###Write in GO
---

[write in go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJvEIjRBSDA&feature=youtu.be)

<p>The schedule's tight on the cluseter tonight so parallelized my code</br>
all those threads and continuations my head's going to explode</br>
and all that boilerplate that FactoryBuilderAdapterDelegateImpl doesn't exsit anymore </br>
seams unjustified give me something simple</br>
don't write in scheme</br>
don't write in c</br>
no more pointers that i forgot to free()</br>
java's verbose python's too slow</br>
it's time you know</br>
write in GO!</br>
write in GO!</br>
no inheritance anymore</br>
write in GO!</br>
write in GO!</br>
there's no do or while just for </br>
i dont'care what your linters say i've got tools for that</br>
the code never botherd me anway</br>
it's funny how some features make every change seem small</br>
And the errors that once slowed me don't get down at all </br>
it's time to see what GO can do cause it seams too good to be true</br>
no long compile times for i'm free</br>
write in GO!</br>
write in GO!</br>
kiss your pointer math goodbye</br>
write in GO!</br>
write in GO!</br>
time to give GC a try</br>
i don't cate if my structures stay on the heap or stack</br>
my program spawns its goroutines without a sound</br>
control is spiraling through buffered channels all around</br>
i don't remeber why i erver once subclassed</br>
i'm never going back</br>
my tests all build and pass</br>
write in GO!</br>
write in GO!</br>
you won't use eclipse anymore</br>
write in GO!</br>
write in GO!</br>
who cares what boost is for </br>
i don't care what the tech leads say </br>
i'll rewrite it all</br>
writing code nenver botherd me anyway<p></br>
